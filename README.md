## Discription
This project was very challenging, yet incredibly fun. What kept me motivated was the opportunity to overcome new obstacles and complete the project successfully. The primary objective of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Throughout the project, I gained a deeper understanding of mongo db and learned new techniques for implementing effective database solutions. Overall, this project provided me with valuable experience and expanded my skill set, equipping me to tackle similar challenges in the future.
